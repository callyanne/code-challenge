Problem 3 Explanation:

Issue 1: WalletBalance has no blockchain attribute

-- On line 52, there is an attempt to access the 'blockchain' attribute of balance, which is of type WalletBalance, which does not exist.
To solve this, the blockchain attribute has been added into the WalletBalance interface.

Issue 2: lhsPriority used but not declared 

-- On line 53 of the original code, the variable 'lhsPriority' is called but it has not been declared. This gives rise to an undefined value.
Following the logic of the code, the variable should have been 'balancePriority' instead.

Issue 3: Line 104 should be formattedBalances, not sortedBalances

-- On line 104 of the solution, the input parameter, balance, should be of interface FormattedWalletBalance. Hence, formattedBalances, which contains
a list of FormattedWalletBalance should be used instead of sortedBalances.

Inefficiency 1: Instead of using a switch statement to handle the searching of priority, we should use a dictionary to improve efficiency

-- On line 33 of the original code, a switch statement is used to return the priorities of each blockchain currency. If there is a long list of 
currencies, doing this could cause the code to be rather verbose and inefficient. Instead, we can use a dictionary, with the key being the currency
name and the value being the priority. This makes the process of searching for the related priority value more efficient. 

Assumption 1: The WalletRow component is defined in a separate file and imported

-- The WalletRow is utilised in the code without any definition of the component.

Assumption 2: The useWalletBalances() function is defined in a separated file and imported

-- The useWalletBalances() function is used to populate the balances which are then filtered and sorted. However, it is not defined in the code.

Assumption 3: BoxProps is an imported component from another file

Additional notes:

-- Since Props does not have any additional attributes as compared to BoxProps, it is possible to remove the interface and just use BoxProps directly.
I am unsure about this hence I did not update the code with this.
